                    Profile A does most of the heavy lifting for this project. It takes in all of the documents that have been pre-parsed by Document.java and collects all the unigrams (words) that it sees and assigns a frequency to that unigram of 1. Additionally, for each new document that gets passed to profile A we are keeping tally of them so that we can make a calculation in the future to determine each unigram's importance to a certain document.
                    <br><br>
                    When Job 1 mapper is finished finding each unigram, Job 1 reducer takes over to compile each unigram into a collective of itself. For example, if the unigram "grass" was seen 12,042 times, instead of having 12,042 individually mapped "grass" unigrams, we have one with the frequency of 12,042. The job one reducer also finds the ni value of a particular unigram, which is the number of documents that a unigram is seen in. If there are 20,000 documents and "grass" is seen in 14,000 of them, then "grass"'s ni value is 14,000.
                    <br><br>
                    Now that job one is done, we move on to job two mapper, whose job is taking the output from job one reducer and calculating the local and max frequencies of the unigrams that are passed to it. 
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, we have made it to the job two reducer. The reducer will complete the first and second half of the of calculation needed for a TF-IDF, the term frequency and the inverse document frequency. To do this, the reducer takes the local frequency of a unigram in a particular document and divides that by the maximum frequency of the unigram, then dividing that by two and adding 0.5. Then to get the IDF value it uses the formula log10(total-number-of-documents / ni-value). Finally it multiplies the TF and the IDF values together to give us the TF-IDF of each unigram in every document in our corpus.

                    Profile B does a lot of the overhead work and turns the TD-IDF values we got from Profile A into something we can use to generate summaries.
                    <br><br>
                    The first thing that Profile B does is takes the TF-IDF values we got from Profile A and makes a usable format, it then assigns each unigram and its value to the corresponding document it was found in using the document ID we got in Profile A. Following this, we run a second mapper to grab each sentence, which is loosely defined by words delimited by a period, question mark, or exclamtion point.
                    <br><br>
                    Now the reducer does the rest of the work. Splitting all of the information we have gathered thus far into maps, getting sentence TF-IDF values, getting the top 5 sentences with the highest values, and converting it into a readable format that corresponds to a particular document.

                    This project took many hours and was very complex and mathematically difficult, but in the end, the accuracy of my project was near flawless and I learned a lot about how to process large amounts of data quickly.
