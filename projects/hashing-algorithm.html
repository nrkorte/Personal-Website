                <p><b>Thought Processes:</b><br>
                    Initializing this project starts off with the table structure itself. This includes the constructor and any variables we need to store information.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p><b>Info: </b>A hashtable can be made in many ways, in my version I am creating here I have chosen to create a two-dimensional array to represent our table. The first array or the "buckets" will be an ArrayList that holds our lists of values in them. The second dimension of the array will be a LinkedList, which will contain the individual values.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The constructor is very simple. It initializes the buckets array and sets all values inside of the array to null. I do this so that when I try to get an index later on, I do not get an IndexOutOfBounds error if I try to access an uninitialized LinkedList.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Above the constructor you can see there are a few variables that we use. Without going into the math behind why prime numbers are beneficial for hashing, all you need to know is that it helps distribute our numbers across our table evenly. So...</p>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li><b>PRIME_NUMBER</b>: Integer used to help spread out our numbers across the table.</li>
                    <li><b>Buckets</b>: This is a list of a list of numbers to create our table structure.</li>
                    <li><b>maxSize</b>: The largest the table is allowed to be, this can be changed later which is why it is not a "final" variable.</li>
                    <li><b>full_buckets</b>: The amount of buckets that have at least one value inside of it, this variable help determine when we need to increase table size.</li>

                <p><b>Thought Processes:</b><br>
                    In these methods I am writing the code that will calculate the index for where a certain value will go and then placing that value in the hash table.
                </p>

                <h4 class="text-center">The insert method</h4>
                <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
                    <img src="../media/insert-method.png" alt="Photo of insert method" class="img-fluid">
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The first thing we do in the insert method is compute the hash value in relation to the value we are trying to store, I will cover the hash method soon. Following this we need to place our value into the hash table in the appropriate index. First we check to see if the bucket is still empty (or null), if it is we create a new LinkedList in that bucket and increase the "full_buckets" global variable to see if we need to resize. If we do, the insert method will call the resize method.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Now we have to check again whether or not the index is currently empty, this might seem redundant to do twice, but when we take a look at the resize method, it will all make sense. If it's empty, make a new LinkedList in the bucket and add the value, if it is not, loop to the end using an iterator and then append it to the end of the LinkedList. This hash table does not allow for duplicate values, so if we see a value we already have in the table, we will return false and nothing will be added.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h4 class="text-center">The hash method</h4>
                <p>
                    This method is used to calculate a hash value that tells us where in our table our value is stored in O(1) time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Info: </b> Think about this. You want to find out if there is a user ID on your database, but your database generates random user IDs that aren't stored in order. This means it could be in any position in the list of people you have in your database. The only option to find that user would be to search every. single. user! That would take forever if there are millions of users. Instead if each user ID relates to a specific hash value that we calculate, you can find that user almost instantly!
                </p>
                <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
                    <img src="../media/hash-method.png" alt="Photo of insert method" class="img-fluid">
                </div><br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Let's find out how. First and most importantly, each hashing algorithm contains a secret key that only those who wrote and use the algorithm know, and sometimes not even they know! This key is what helps us "randomize" the position on the table. It's not actually random, it's mathematical, but appears random to others. In my algorithm I take the value and the key that we've collected and concatenate them together to make this key unique to each value we pass to the method.
                </p>
                <br>
                <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
                    <img src="../media/hash-math.png" alt="Formula for calculating hash value" class="img-fluid">
                </div><br>
                <p>
                    The above formula shows how we use all the information we have to get the hash value. In this formula, PRIMENUMBER is the PRIME_NUMBER value we stored at the top of this class and never changes. "n" is the number of characters in our input, the key and the value we are concatenating. Ord(c<sub>i</sub>) represents the ascii value of each character in our input. And finally, tableSize is the size of the current table. This calculation is done one each char in our string to get the hash value.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    When the calculation is done, we take the absolute value of our final answer and mod it one more time to make sure it fits into our table. This is our hash value.

                <p><b>Thought Processes:</b><br>
                    This method increases the size of the table by 50% any time that 75% or more of the buckets are full. A bucket being full means that it has at least one value stored in it.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                    This function starts by redefining the current max size to 1.5 times what it was, thus creating enough buckets to store all values without as many collisions. Then, for each of those new buckets we initialize them to null too allow our future loops to know what the index bounds are.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Next, we essentially re-insert all of the values that were in the table with the new table size. If the bucket is full, iterate over the linked list and append to the end, if not, create a new linked list and then add the value to the beginning.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Finally, we set the global variable "buckets" to the new set of buckets we created, effectively increasing the size of our table by 50%.
